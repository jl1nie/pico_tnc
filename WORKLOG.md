## 2026-04-27

### Summary
デバッグ用途として、受信パケットなしで署名リカバリ処理を再現できる `sign recovery {JSON}<署名>` コマンドを追加。

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/decode.c`
- `pico_tnc/decode.h`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `sign recovery ...` で手入力した `{JSON}+base64署名(88文字)` を受信時と同じ検証表示処理へ投入可能にした。
- 受信経路の署名検証ロジックを共通化し、無線受信時の動作は維持したままコマンド経由でも同一の表示（署名検証・QSLカード描画）を利用する。
- Help/README (EN/JP) に新コマンドを追記。
- RAM/queue impact note: 既存バッファ再利用のみで固定RAM増加なし、キューサイズ変更なし。

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j4`
- In this environment, firmware build cannot complete because Pico SDK path is not configured (`PICO_SDK_PATH` missing).

### Remaining risks / TODO
- `sign recovery` は受信AX.25ヘッダを持たないため、`FR` 欠落QSLの送信元表示は `*MANUAL*` フォールバックとなる。
- 実機で `sign recovery` と通常受信表示の差分（改行・タイミング）を最終確認する必要あり。

## 2026-04-22


### Summary
履歴復帰時の後始末を統一するため、保存行へ戻った分岐で `history_nav_active` 直接更新をやめ、`tty_history_reset_nav()` を呼ぶように調整。

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/tty.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `tty_history_next()` の保存行復帰分岐で `tty_history_reset_nav()` を使用し、`active/index/saved_len/saved_cursor` を一括で初期化。
- 履歴ナビ復帰後に古い保存状態が残らないようにした（表示/操作仕様は従来どおり）。
- RAM/queue impact note: 追加メモリなし、キュー変更なし。

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j4`
- In this environment, firmware build cannot complete because Pico SDK path is not configured (`PICO_SDK_PATH` missing).

### Remaining risks / TODO
- 実機端末（USB/UART）で、履歴復帰後に連続して履歴操作した際の体感挙動を最終確認する必要あり。


### Summary
履歴ナビゲーションの保存状態にカーソル位置を追加し、履歴編集行へ戻る際にカーソル位置も復元するよう修正。

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/tty.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `history_nav_saved_cursor[TTY_N]` を追加し、履歴ナビ開始時に `ttyp->cmd_cursor` を保存。
- `tty_set_cmdline()` は従来どおり末尾カーソル配置のまま維持。
- 新規 `tty_set_cmdline_with_cursor()` を追加し、履歴保存行へ戻るときのみ保存カーソルを復元。
- 復元カーソルは `0..cmd_idx` にクランプして適用。
- RAM/queue impact note: `uint16_t[TTY_N]` 追加分のみ固定RAMが微増。キューサイズ変更なし。

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j4`
- In this environment, firmware build cannot complete because Pico SDK path is not configured (`PICO_SDK_PATH` missing).

### Remaining risks / TODO
- 実機端末（USB/UART）で、履歴復帰時のカーソル位置復元挙動を確認する必要あり。

### Summary
Fixed full-history navigation regression: prevent `↑` wrap from oldest to newest, and allow `↓` from oldest to move toward newer entries when ring is full.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/tty.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `tty_history_prev()` now:
  - uses an explicit `just_started` path so first `↑` from unselected state can always move.
  - blocks additional `↑` only when the current active entry is actually `oldest`, preventing wrap-around in full ring.
- `tty_history_next()` now:
  - treats `history_nav_index == cmd_history_head` as a real oldest entry only in the full-ring case (`count == slots`) and moves to newer entry on `↓`.
  - keeps prior sentinel/bell behavior for non-full history.
- RAM/queue impact note: no buffer or queue size changes; only history boundary conditions were adjusted.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j4`
- In this environment, firmware build cannot complete because Pico SDK path is not configured (`PICO_SDK_PATH` missing).
- Regression viewpoints:
  - 7 entries: first `↑` works, oldest boundary bell maintained, `↓` returns to edit buffer at `head`.
  - 8 entries (full): oldest is reachable, extra `↑` at oldest bells (no wrap), `↓` from oldest moves newer.
  - 9 entries (overwrite): boundaries remain consistent after overwrite start.

### Remaining risks / TODO
- Runtime verification with actual terminal clients is still pending due build environment limitation.

### Summary
Fixed a full-ring edge case in `tty_history_prev()` where the oldest command could not be reached when `cmd_history_count == CMD_HISTORY_SLOTS`.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/tty.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Updated destination validity guard so `distance_from_head == 0` is treated as valid only when the history ring is full.
- This restores access to the oldest entry in the full-ring case while preserving previous behavior for non-full history:
  - 0 entries: `↑` bell only.
  - oldest reached: additional `↑` bell only.
  - `↓` path and head-return edit restore behavior unchanged.
- RAM/queue impact note: no buffer sizes, queue sizes, or output path allocations were changed.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j4`
- In this environment, firmware build cannot complete because Pico SDK path is not configured (`PICO_SDK_PATH` missing).
- Regression check viewpoints:
  - 7 entries: oldest stop bell behavior maintained.
  - 8 entries (full): oldest entry now reachable.
  - 9 entries (overwrite): newest/oldest boundaries remain consistent after overwrite start.

### Remaining risks / TODO
- Runtime verification on target USB/UART terminals is still pending due build environment limitation.

### Summary
Fixed `tty_history_prev()` so the first `↑` from the initial unselected state (`history_nav_index == cmd_history_head`) always moves to the latest history entry.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/tty.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- History-up navigation now validates the *destination index* instead of blocking based on the current index being oldest.
- Maintained expected behavior:
  - With 0 history entries, `↑` rings bell only.
  - After reaching oldest entry, additional `↑` rings bell only.
  - `↓` still navigates newer entries, and when reaching `head` it restores the saved in-progress edit line.
- RAM/queue impact note: no buffer sizes or queue constants changed; only navigation boundary logic was adjusted.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j4`
- In this environment, firmware build cannot complete because Pico SDK path is not configured (`PICO_SDK_PATH` missing).
- Regression test viewpoints recorded for history ring behavior:
  - 7 entries (`count=7`): confirm first `↑` from `head` reaches latest, repeated `↑` stops with bell at oldest, `↓` returns and restores saved edit at `head`.
  - 8 entries (`count=8`, full ring): same checks across wrap boundary.
  - 9 entries (overwrite starts): confirm oldest is dropped, newest is reachable on first `↑`, and oldest boundary/bell behavior remains correct.

### Remaining risks / TODO
- Runtime verification on actual terminal clients (USB/UART) is still pending due build environment limitation.

### Summary
Added a `termtest` command for raw terminal byte inspection mode.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Added new CLI command `termtest`.
- `termtest` enters a dedicated pending-input mode and prints startup guidance:
  - `termtest mode`
  - `Press keys to inspect received bytes.`
  - `Ctrl+C to exit.`
- In this mode, input is consumed before normal line editor/ANSI key handling, so escape sequences, arrows, delete, and other edit keys are shown as raw received bytes instead of being interpreted.
- Received bytes are emitted as hexadecimal (`0xNN`) with readable labels for common control bytes (`BS`, `TAB`, `CR`, `LF`, `ESC`, `DEL`).
- Printable ASCII bytes are appended as readable characters in the same line.
- Mode exits only on `Ctrl+C`, then prints `Exited termtest mode.` and returns to normal command prompt.
- Queue/RAM impact note: this adds a small fixed command-layer context (`16`-byte capture buffer + metadata) and two small temporary formatting buffers during flush; no queue size constants were changed.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j4`
- In this environment, full firmware build cannot complete due missing Pico SDK configuration (`PICO_SDK_PATH` not set), so hardware/runtime verification of `termtest` remains pending.

### Remaining risks / TODO
- Byte grouping for multi-byte terminal escape sequences is based on a short idle-time flush window; grouping may differ slightly across terminal/transport latency conditions.
- Confirm behavior on actual USB/UART terminals used in operation (especially CR/LF transmission differences and key-repeat bursts).

### Summary
Updated `sign qsl` wizard completion behavior to auto-register an equivalent one-line `sign qsl ...` command into CLI history.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/tty.c`
- `pico_tnc/tty.h`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Added public history push API `tty_history_push()` so command-layer flows can register synthetic history entries.
- In `sign qsl` wizard mode, after all fields are entered, firmware now builds a replayable one-line command:
  - `sign qsl <TO> -rs <RS> -date <DATE> -time <TIME> [-freq <FREQ>] [-mode <MODE>] [-qth <QTH>]`
- The generated replay line is pushed to command history before entering the existing sign/tx confirmation flow.
- DATE/TIME in the replay line are normalized when possible (`YYYYMMDD`, `HHMMTZ`); if normalization fails, original wizard text is retained.
- Queue/RAM impact note: change reuses existing history storage and adds one temporary formatting buffer on stack in wizard consume path; queue constants are unchanged.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j4`
- In this environment, full firmware build cannot complete due missing Pico SDK configuration (`PICO_SDK_PATH` not set).

### Remaining risks / TODO
- Replay command builder currently appends options without shell-style quoting; fields containing special characters are still stored literally as typed.

### Summary
Added command history and in-line command editing for terminal input, including ANSI cursor/history keys and Ctrl-key fallbacks for non-ANSI terminals.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/tnc.h`
- `pico_tnc/tty.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Increased CLI input line buffer from 255 bytes to 1024 bytes (`CMD_BUF_LEN=1024`).
- Added command history ring buffer: 8 entries × 1024 bytes.
- If input exceeds 1024 bytes, additional tail bytes are ignored (truncated).
- Added ANSI escape sequence handling in command-wait state:
  - `↑/↓`: previous/next history
  - `←/→`: move cursor left/right
  - `Home/End`: move to line start/end
  - `Delete`: delete character at cursor
- Added equivalent Ctrl-key operations for non-ANSI terminals:
  - `Ctrl+P/Ctrl+N` history prev/next
  - `Ctrl+B/Ctrl+F` cursor left/right
  - `Ctrl+A/Ctrl+E` line start/end
  - `Ctrl+H` backspace
- Added in-line insertion/deletion support (editing in the middle of a command line) with prompt-line redraw.
- RAM/queue impact note: this change adds fixed RAM for history storage (~8KB + small nav state), and redraw output increases transient terminal output volume during cursor editing; no queue size constants were changed.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j4`
- In this environment, full firmware build cannot complete due missing Pico SDK configuration (`PICO_SDK_PATH` not set).

### Remaining risks / TODO
- ANSI escape handling targets common VT-style sequences (`CSI`/`SS3` variants for arrows/home/end and `3~` for delete); behavior on uncommon terminal emulators should be confirmed on actual operation setups.
- Current CLI redraw assumes prompt text `cmd: ` for line refresh and is intended for idle command input mode.

### Summary
Added a guarded CLI command `system usb_bootloader` that requires a strict `Y` → `E` → `S` → `Enter` key sequence within 10 seconds before rebooting into USB BOOTSEL mode.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.h`
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/main.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Added `SYSTEM` command handling with `system usb_bootloader` subcommand.
- On `system usb_bootloader`, firmware now prints:
  - `WARNING: Enter USB bootloader mode?`
  - `This will disconnect the current session.`
  - `Press [Y] [E] [S] [Enter] in order within 10 seconds to continue; any other key aborts.`
- Added a dedicated pending-input state for USB bootloader confirmation:
  - state machine: `WAIT_Y`, `WAIT_E`, `WAIT_S`, `WAIT_ENTER`
  - any unexpected single character aborts immediately
  - accepts `Enter` as `\r`, `\n`, or `\r\n` as sequential input (`\r` triggers success, following `\n` is ignored by reset path)
  - 10-second timeout aborts automatically
- Success path prints `Entering USB bootloader...` then calls `reset_usb_boot(0, 0);`.
- Abort/timeout path prints `USB bootloader entry aborted.` and returns to normal CLI prompt handling.
- Added `cmd_poll()` to monitor timeout in the main loop and integrated it in `main.c`.
- Updated help and README command listings (English/Japanese) to document the new command.
- RAM/queue impact note: only a small new pending-context struct and a few short output lines were added; no queue size constants or buffer limits were changed.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j4`
- In this environment, full firmware build cannot complete due missing Pico SDK configuration (`PICO_SDK_PATH` not set).

### Remaining risks / TODO
- Strict per-character validation intentionally treats noisy or line-buffered terminals as abort cases; behavior should be confirmed on actual field terminal setups used by maintainers.

## 2026-04-21

### Summary
Implemented `sign qsl` command with argument mode and interactive wizard mode, then routed finalized payloads through the existing sign/TX confirmation flow.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Added `sign qsl` command flow:
  - argument mode: `sign qsl <to> -rs ... -date ... -time ... [-freq ...] [-mode ...] [-qth ...]`
  - wizard mode: `sign qsl` (no args), prompting `TO/RS/DATE/TIME/FREQ/MODE/QTH`.
- Added QSL field normalization helpers:
  - `QSL` and `MODE` uppercased.
  - `DATE` normalized to `YYYYMMDD` from `YYYYMMDD` or separated forms (`/`, `-`, space).
  - `TIME` normalized to `HHMMTZ`; when timezone is omitted, `JST` is appended.
- Added QSL JSON payload builder with fixed key layout:
  - `{"QSL":"...","S":"...","D":"...","T":"...","F":"...","M":"...","P":"..."}`
- Refactored sign send path into shared helper so `sign msg` and `sign qsl` both use the same signing, byte-size check, and Enter/ESC TX confirmation behavior.
- Added lightweight software clock state in command layer:
  - progresses from `time_us_64()` anchor while firmware is running.
  - wizard DATE/TIME prompt shows presets when clock is set.
  - on successful `sign qsl` finalize, input `DATE/TIME` updates the software clock.
- Help/README (EN/JP) updated to document `sign qsl`.
- Added one pending-input state for QSL wizard interaction; queue sizes and buffer constants were unchanged.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j4`
- In this environment, full firmware build cannot complete due missing Pico SDK configuration (`PICO_SDK_PATH` not set).

### Remaining risks / TODO
- Wizard input currently supports ASCII printable range with terminal echo semantics matching existing command input; multibyte input and locale-specific entry are not handled.
- `-qth` argument consumes the remaining tail of the command line for simplicity; adding option-reordering/quoting rules can be done in a follow-up parser enhancement.

## 2026-04-21

### Summary
Adjusted `privkey gen` entropy counter rendering to avoid CR-based overwrite and increased the initial entropy counter value.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `privkey gen` progress now prints the counter once (`Remaining entropy counter: 1000`) and updates only the numeric field using backspace-based fixed-width redraw (`\b` x5 + `%5d`), instead of carriage-return line overwrite.
- Initial entropy counter value changed from `640` to `1000`.
- No queue size constants were changed; output volume per update is reduced versus full-line redraw, which should slightly reduce transient USB/TTY queue pressure.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j4`
- In this environment, full firmware build cannot complete due missing Pico SDK configuration (`PICO_SDK_PATH` not set).

### Remaining risks / TODO
- Some terminal emulators may handle backspace redraw differently when local echo or line buffering is enabled; verify on target terminal clients used in operation.

## 2026-04-20

### Summary
Implemented initial `sign` command support for plain text signing as `sign msg <text>` with interactive TX confirmation.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Added `SIGN` command parser entry with `sign msg <text>` subcommand.
- `sign msg` now:
  - validates key slot + `MYCALL`/`UNPROTO` presence.
  - builds JSON payload as `{"msg":"<text>"}` (with basic JSON escaping for `"` and `\`).
  - signs the JSON string via `mona_keyslot_sign_message()`.
  - concatenates JSON + signature and prints the packet text.
  - measures and prints signing time in microseconds.
  - computes AX.25 UI frame length and prints `< 256byte OK` / `>= 256byte NG`.
  - waits for `[Enter]` to TX or `[ESC]` to abort.
- Added pending-input state for sign TX confirmation:
  - Enter sends one UI frame using current `MYCALL`/`UNPROTO`.
  - ESC aborts with `Aborted by user.`.
- Updated HELP/README (EN/JP) command documentation to include `sign msg`.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j4`
- In this environment, full firmware build cannot complete due missing Pico SDK configuration (`PICO_SDK_PATH` not set).

### Remaining risks / TODO
- Sign payload buffer is capped at 255 bytes (`CMD_BUF_LEN` interaction + signature length); longer messages are rejected before TX prompt.
- Added text output lines for signing status and packet preview increase transient USB/TTY queue usage; queue constants were not changed, so behavior depends on existing `tty_write` pacing and queue headroom.
- `sign qsl ...` and verify command paths are still pending by plan.

## 2026-04-18

### Summary
Added a new `about` command that prints version/edition and third-party component attribution text, and documented it in help/README outputs.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Added `ABOUT` command parsing in the command table (`about` case-insensitive) and implemented multiline output text in English only.
- Added help line entry:
  - English help: `ABOUT (about) - Version Information`
  - Japanese help: `ABOUT (about) - バージョン情報` (description only)
- Added README command documentation in both English and Japanese command lists.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j4`
- In this environment, full firmware build cannot complete due missing Pico SDK configuration (`PICO_SDK_PATH` not set).

### Remaining risks / TODO
- `about` output is a relatively long multiline response; no queue constants were changed, so it relies on existing line-by-line `tty_write_str` behavior and available TX queue headroom.
- Confirm on real device terminal clients that long attribution output remains readable under current serial pacing.

## 2026-04-18

### Summary
Integrated vendored `secp256k1` into firmware build wiring and replaced minimal crypto stubs with real RIPEMD-160 + secp256k1 operations so `privkey show` can derive/print actual addresses.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/CMakeLists.txt`
- `pico_tnc/mona_backend_minimal.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Firmware build now includes vendored `secp256k1` as a subdirectory target and links `secp256k1` into `pico_tnc`.
- `mona_backend_minimal` now provides:
  - RIPEMD-160 implementation (for HASH160 address generation).
  - secp256k1 compressed pubkey creation.
  - compact sign/recover/verify plumbing via `secp256k1` API.
- `mona_backend_minimal_has_full_crypto()` now reports `true`, so `privkey show` address derivation path can run with real backend primitives.

### Validation status
- Syntax-checked backend translation unit with secp headers:
  - `gcc -std=c11 -fsyntax-only -I./pico_tnc -I./pico_tnc/secp256k1/include pico_tnc/mona_backend_minimal.c`
- Firmware CMake configure attempted:
  - `cmake -S . -B build` fails in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` is not configured.
  - `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT=ON cmake -S . -B build` fails due outbound network restriction (`CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`) while cloning pico-sdk.

### Remaining risks / TODO
- Full firmware compile/link validation is still pending in an environment with local pico-sdk access.
- secp256k1 integration increases flash/RAM footprint; measure map/size deltas on target build environment before release.

## 2026-04-18

### Summary
Implemented Monacoin address derivation in `privkey show` so the address section now attempts real `p2pkh (M)`, `p2sh (P)`, and `p2wpkh (mona1)` calculation from the persisted private key instead of fixed placeholder text.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `privkey show` now calls `mona_keypair_from_secret()` and prints derived addresses:
  - `addr_M` for p2pkh
  - `addr_P` for p2sh
  - `addr_mona1` for p2wpkh
- If derivation fails, each line prints `(calculation failed)` instead of `(unavailable in this stage)`.
- Queue behavior and output flow are unchanged; only line contents were updated.

### Validation status
- Static review confirms placeholder lines were replaced with derive-and-print logic in the `privkey show` path.
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`, but full build verification could not complete because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured in this environment.

### Remaining risks / TODO
- Current backend (`mona_backend_minimal`) still reports `mona_backend_minimal_has_full_crypto() == false`; if required crypto primitives remain unavailable at runtime, address lines will show `(calculation failed)`.

## 2026-04-18

### Summary
Implemented `privkey` type switching via `privkey set [m|p|mona1|p2pkh|p2sh|p2wpkh]` so users can normalize and persist only the active address type without re-importing key material.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `privkey set` now accepts address-type aliases (`m`, `p`, `mona1`) and canonical names (`p2pkh`, `p2sh`, `p2wpkh`) as a type-only operation.
- Type-only `privkey set` normalizes through `mona_parse_addr_type()` and stores the canonical active type in persistent parameters.
- Existing key import behavior (`privkey set <WIF or RAW>`) remains unchanged.
- Help and README command descriptions now document combined type/WIF/RAW `set` usage.

### Validation status
- Static command-path review confirms:
  - type-only `set` path is evaluated before WIF/RAW parsing.
  - type normalization uses the same parser as `privkey gen`.
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`, but full build verification could not complete because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured in this environment.

### Remaining risks / TODO
- `privkey type` is currently implemented through `privkey set <type>` UX; if a dedicated subcommand syntax is required later, parser/help text should be extended in a separate step.

## 2026-04-17

### Summary
Added `privkey show` with an interactive safety prompt so key persistence can be tested end-to-end (write/import then read/display) without introducing full signing backend integration.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.h`
- `pico_tnc/tty.c`
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/mona_backend_minimal.h`
- `pico_tnc/mona_backend_minimal.c`
- `pico_tnc/CMakeLists.txt`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Added `privkey show` command:
  - prints SECURITY NOTICE and waits for one key input.
  - Enter (`CR`) proceeds and prints key data.
  - any other key aborts and prints `Aborted by user.`.
- Added pending-input handling hooks in `cmd`/`tty` so confirmation can be handled before normal command parsing resumes.
- Added minimal mona crypto bootstrap (`mona_backend_minimal_init()`):
  - provides SHA-256 only (sufficient for WIF Base58Check encode/decode used by `set`/`show`).
  - keeps RIPEMD160/HMAC/secp funcs as unsupported stubs (no sign/verify enablement in this step).
- `privkey show` output now includes:
  - typed WIFs for `p2pkh`, `p2sh` (`p2wpkh-p2sh:`), `p2wpkh` (`p2wpkh:`)
  - raw hex key
  - active type
  - address lines are explicitly marked unavailable in this stage.

### Validation status
- Static checks:
  - command table includes `PRIVKEY` and `show/gen/set` paths.
  - pending-input interception path is wired in `tty_input()`.
  - build list includes `mona_backend_minimal.c` and excludes `tools/*`.
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`, but full build verification could not complete because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured in this environment.

### Remaining risks / TODO
- Address derivation is intentionally deferred until secp+hash backend is implemented; `show` currently prints address lines as unavailable.
- Minimal backend currently supports only SHA-256 needed for WIF encode/decode; sign/verify path remains intentionally disabled.

## 2026-04-17

### Summary
Implemented the first staged integration step for `libmona_pico` keyslot persistence without adding signing/verification runtime dependencies:
- extended persistent settings with minimal Monacoin keyslot fields (raw 32-byte secret, valid flag, compressed flag, active address type)
- added `privkey gen [m|p|mona1|p2pkh|p2sh|p2wpkh]`
- added `privkey set <WIF or RAW>`
- integrated only required `libmona_pico` core/adapter sources into firmware build (`tools/*` remains excluded)

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/tnc.h`
- `pico_tnc/tnc.c`
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `pico_tnc/CMakeLists.txt`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- New command `privkey gen [type]`:
  - generates a random 32-byte secret and stores it in `param`.
  - stores `compressed=true` and normalized active type (`p2pkh`/`p2sh`/`p2wpkh`).
  - supports aliases `m`, `p`, `mona1`.
- New command `privkey set <WIF or RAW>`:
  - imports typed/untyped WIF or 64-hex raw key using `mona_pico_api`.
  - typed WIF updates active type from prefix.
  - untyped WIF and RAW keep the existing active type; if no prior key exists, default type is `p2pkh`.
- Persistence format remains minimal:
  - `mona_privkey[32]`
  - `mona_privkey_valid`
  - `mona_privkey_compressed`
  - `mona_active_type`
- No WIF/address strings are persisted.

### Validation status
- Command-level static validation by source review:
  - alias normalization is handled via `mona_parse_addr_type()`.
  - typed WIF policy (`keep_active_type_if_untyped=true`) is wired in `cmd_privkey`.
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`, but this environment still lacks `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`), so full firmware build verification could not complete.

### Remaining risks / TODO
- Random secret generation currently checks only for all-zero and does not enforce secp256k1 curve-order bounds; tighten after backend/sign path integration.
- Existing flash records created by older firmware may contain `0xff` in newly added fields; startup sanitization now clamps invalid values to safe defaults.
- `privkey show`/`privkey type` and sign/verify command surfaces are not implemented in this step.

## 2026-04-05

### Summary
Removed the unused test-packet replay path and related files from normal firmware builds:
- removed `TEST_PACKET`-guarded test hooks from `main.c` (`test.h` include, `test_init()`, `test()`)
- removed `test.c` and `packet_table.c` from `pico_tnc/CMakeLists.txt` sources
- deleted `pico_tnc/test.c`, `pico_tnc/test.h`, `pico_tnc/packet_table.c`, and `pico_tnc/packet_table.h`

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/main.c`, `pico_tnc/CMakeLists.txt`, `pico_tnc/test.c`, `pico_tnc/test.h`, `pico_tnc/packet_table.c`, `pico_tnc/packet_table.h`, `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Normal firmware runtime path no longer contains dormant test replay hooks.
- Large `packet_table` blob and replay implementation are removed from the repository tree and default build, so ROM usage is expected to decrease.
- No intended changes to AX.25, send/receive, command handling, or help behavior.

### Validation status
- `rg -n "packet_table|packet_table\.h|test_init\(|\btest\(\)|TEST_PACKET|#include "test\.h"" pico_tnc` confirms no remaining matches.
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`, but this environment lacks `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`), so full build verification could not complete.

### Remaining risks / TODO
- If test replay is needed again later, restore deleted files and re-add source entries in `pico_tnc/CMakeLists.txt` and call sites in `main.c` intentionally.

## 2026-04-05

### Summary
Removed unused TRACE-related code as one grouped change:
- deleted `cmd_trace()` implementation, TRACE enum, command table registration, and DISP trace output
- removed TRACE lines from English/Japanese help text
- removed `param.trace` member from `param_t` and its initializer entry

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`, `pico_tnc/help.c`, `pico_tnc/tnc.h`, `pico_tnc/tnc.c`, `WORKLOG.md`

### Validation status
- `rg -n "param\\.trace|cmd_trace|TRace|TRACE|TR_OFF|TR_XMIT|TR_RCV|\\{ \\\"TRACE\\\"" pico_tnc` : no remaining references in source.
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`, but this environment lacks `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`), so full build verification could not complete.

### Remaining risks / TODO
- None specific beyond required environment setup for full firmware build.

## 2026-04-04

### Request
In `help` / `help ja` output, check whether `MYCALL` and `UNPROTO` are set, and if not, display a warning message in the selected language.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `help` now checks `param.mycall` and `param.unproto[0]` when the command starts.
- If either value is unset, help output first prints a 3-line warning in the active help language:
  - English (`help`)
  - Japanese (`help ja` / `help ja sjis` / `help ja utf8`)
- Existing non-blocking one-line-at-a-time help output flow is preserved.
- A blank separator line is inserted after the warning block before normal help text.

### Validation
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`.
- Build could not run in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Risks / TODO
- Warning lines add a few extra help output lines, so queue usage duration (not per-line maximum) increases slightly while help is printing.
- Per-line output size and line buffer behavior remain unchanged (`utf8_to_sjis_line()` temporary buffer is still 256 bytes).

## 2026-04-04

### Request
Initialize repository workflow files for ChatGPT/Codex-assisted development.

### Files changed
- `AGENTS.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `.logs/2026-04-04-bootstrap.md`

### Behavior changes
- No firmware behavior changes.
- Added repository instructions, work log template, and current project plan.

### Validation
- Files added only. No firmware build required.

### Risks / TODO
- Keep this file updated after each meaningful code change.

## 2026-04-04

### Request
Split the help command related implementation into `help.c` and `help.h`.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.h`
- `pico_tnc/CMakeLists.txt`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- No intended command behavior changes.
- Moved the `HELP`/`?` command text output implementation out of `cmd.c` into a dedicated `help.c` module.

### Validation
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`.
- Build could not run in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Risks / TODO
- `help.c` adds one additional compilation unit, but no new queues or runtime buffers were introduced.
- Help text still uses the same static string; RAM/queue behavior should remain unchanged.

## 2026-04-04

### Request
Convert separated `help.c` handling to non-blocking one-line-at-a-time output.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.h`
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/main.c`
- `PLAN.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- HELP/`?` now starts an internal help send state instead of writing the full text immediately.
- `help_poll()` sends at most one help line per call, appending CRLF per line.
- `OK` for HELP is returned only after all help lines are sent.
- Other commands keep existing immediate `OK` behavior.

### Validation
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`.
- Build could not run in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Risks / TODO
- Help output now spans multiple main-loop iterations; on very slow links, completion timing depends on loop cadence.
- Design assumes each help line is sufficiently shorter than `QUEUE_SIZE`.

## 2026-04-04

### Request
Generate UTF-8→Shift_JIS (JIS X 0208 level-1 kanji) C code table using PHP `mb_convert_encoding()`, keep output readable with 8 entries per line, add visible character comments, and place generated files under `./pico_tnc`.

### Files changed
- `tools/gen_sjis_level1_table.php`
- `pico_tnc/sjis_level1_table.h`
- `pico_tnc/sjis_level1_table.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Added PHP generator that filters to Shift_JIS level-1 range (`0x889F` to `0x9872`) with UTF-8 round-trip validation.
- Generator now writes both generated files to `./pico_tnc` (`sjis_level1_table.h`, `sjis_level1_table.c`).
- Generated C table keeps 8 initializers per line and inserts one human-readable comment line (`// 文字 ...`) per 8-entry block.
- No runtime firmware behavior changes yet (data only; not wired into command/IO paths).

### Validation
- Ran `php tools/gen_sjis_level1_table.php` successfully and regenerated `pico_tnc/sjis_level1_table.h` / `pico_tnc/sjis_level1_table.c` (2,965 entries).
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`.
- Build could not run in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Risks / TODO
- Table is large; if linked into firmware later, flash/RAM impact should be reviewed at integration time.
- Generation currently targets SJIS byte-range criteria for first-level kanji; variant-specific requirements may need additional filtering rules.

## 2026-04-04

### Request
Add Japanese help text in UTF-8, add `help ja`/`help ja sjis`/`help ja utf8` behavior, and add UTF-8→SJIS line conversion using `sjis_level1_table`.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `pico_tnc/sjis_level1_tablehelp.c`
- `pico_tnc/sjis_level1_tablehelp.h`
- `pico_tnc/CMakeLists.txt`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- English help now starts with: `JAPANESE HELP: help ja sjis | help ja utf8`.
- Added parameterized help command handling:
  - `help` (unchanged English help)
  - `help ja` and `help ja sjis` (Japanese help output encoded as SJIS bytes)
  - `help ja utf8` (Japanese help output in UTF-8)
- Added UTF-8→SJIS conversion function with 1-line conversion and 256-byte line buffer usage.
- Japanese SJIS conversion path uses `sjis_level1_table` for level-1 kanji and a small supplemental map for ASCII/hiragana/common punctuation.

### Validation
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`.
- Build could not run in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Risks / TODO
- Help line conversion uses a fixed 256-byte temporary buffer per output line in `help_poll()`; lines longer than that are truncated to fit.
- Queue behavior remains line-at-a-time (non-blocking help poll), but SJIS lines may be up to 2 bytes/character and can increase per-line write size relative to ASCII-only help.

## 2026-04-04

### Request
Refactor Japanese help Shift_JIS output so UTF-8→Shift_JIS conversion is a single path integrated in `help.c`, while keeping generated level-1 kanji table files untouched.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `pico_tnc/CMakeLists.txt`
- `pico_tnc/sjis_level1_tablehelp.c` (deleted)
- `pico_tnc/sjis_level1_tablehelp.h` (deleted)
- `PLAN.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Consolidated Japanese help UTF-8→Shift_JIS conversion logic into `help.c` so `help ja sjis` always passes through one conversion path.
- Japanese UTF-8 source lines are now defined in `help.c` and converted per line only when SJIS mode is selected.
- Added Katakana range mapping (`U+30A1`..`U+30F6`) to the same conversion function used for hiragana/symbols/level-1 kanji.
- Unmapped code points still fall back to `?`.
- Non-blocking `help_poll()` line-by-line send behavior remains unchanged.

### Validation
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`.
- Build could not run in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Risks / TODO
- Conversion still uses linear search over the level-1 table per character; acceptable for help text volume but not optimized.
- Per-line temporary SJIS buffer remains 256 bytes; very long lines are truncated to fit, as before.
- Queue behavior remains one-line-at-a-time; SJIS lines can consume more bytes per line than UTF-8 ASCII-heavy lines.

## 2026-04-04

### Request
Centralize UTF-8→Shift_JIS conversion behavior in the PHP generator, regenerate the table outputs, and simplify `help.c` to UTF-8 decode + generated table lookup + `?` fallback while preserving non-blocking line-by-line help output.

### Files changed
- `tools/gen_sjis_level1_table.php`
- `pico_tnc/sjis_level1_table.h`
- `pico_tnc/sjis_level1_table.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `PLAN.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Expanded generator output ordering to: hiragana, katakana, first-level kanji, then symbols.
- Added symbol section at table tail (ASCII and required Japanese punctuation) to reduce C-side handwritten exceptions.
- Removed handwritten hiragana/katakana/symbol exception conversion logic from `help.c`; conversion now uses generated-table lookup plus `?` fallback.
- Preserved existing non-blocking `help_poll()` behavior and per-line send flow.

### Validation
- Ran `php tools/gen_sjis_level1_table.php` successfully to regenerate `pico_tnc/sjis_level1_table.h` and `.c`.
- Verified generated table contains requested words/marks coverage (`コマンド`, `キー`, `シリアル`, `デジピータ`, `キャリブレーション`, `・`, `ー`, `「」`) via script check.
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`.
- Build could not run in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Risks / TODO
- `lookup_sjis_from_level1()` remains linear search per decoded character; acceptable for help text volume but not optimized for large streams.
- Queue behavior and `QUEUE_SIZE` were intentionally left unchanged.

## 2026-04-04

### Request
Adjust UTF-8→Shift_JIS centralization so pure ASCII is not listed in the generated table and is passed through directly at runtime.

### Files changed
- `tools/gen_sjis_level1_table.php`
- `pico_tnc/sjis_level1_table.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Removed ASCII code points from the generated symbol section in `sjis_level1_table.c`.
- `help.c` now passes ASCII (`U+0000`..`U+007F`) through directly without table lookup.
- Non-ASCII conversion path remains generated-table lookup with `?` fallback.
- Non-blocking `help_poll()` line-by-line send behavior remains unchanged.

### Validation
- Ran `php tools/gen_sjis_level1_table.php` successfully and regenerated outputs.
- Ran script validation:
  - confirmed ASCII space (`0x0020`) is absent from table
  - confirmed requested Japanese words/symbols coverage still present (`missing none`).
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`.
- Build could not run in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Risks / TODO
- Table lookup remains linear search per non-ASCII character; acceptable for help text volume.
- Queue behavior and `QUEUE_SIZE` remain unchanged by this adjustment.

## 2026-04-06

### Summary
Implemented AXHANG end-to-end and then refined it to modern ms-based UX:
- added AXHANG parameter, command, DISP output, and TX state-machine hang handling
- transitioned AXHANG internal unit to milliseconds with parser support for decimals and unit suffixes (`ms`, `s`)
- kept backward compatibility where unitless numeric input is treated as legacy 10ms units
- updated AXHANG storage type to `uint16_t`
- rounded sub-millisecond inputs to nearest millisecond and set valid range to `0..1000ms`

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/tnc.h`
- `pico_tnc/tnc.c`
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/send.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `AXHANG` now stores and displays milliseconds (e.g. `AXHANG 150ms`), stored as `uint16_t`.
- Input examples:
  - `axhang 12` -> 120ms (legacy-compatible)
  - `axhang 12.5` -> 125ms (legacy-compatible)
  - `axhang 250ms` -> 250ms
  - `axhang 0.35s` -> 350ms
- Fractional inputs are rounded to nearest millisecond.
- Send hang timeout compare uses elapsed tick time converted to milliseconds.

### Validation status
- `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4` attempted; build did not run because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured in this environment.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- `param_t` layout changed (`axhang` unit/width/type), so persisted flash data from older firmware may decode unexpectedly; startup clamp enforces `0..1000ms`.
- AXHANG command/help text became slightly longer; no queue-size constants were changed and output remains line-based.

## 2026-04-06

### Request
Add `cmd_axdelay()` and register `AXDELAY`, while modernizing delay UX for TX delay handling with millisecond-based `uint16_t` storage and unit parsing.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/tnc.h`
- `pico_tnc/tnc.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Added `AXDELAY` command and command table registration.
- `TXDELAY`/`AXDELAY` now parse `n`, `nms`, and `ns` with decimal input support.
  - unitless `n` keeps backward compatibility as legacy `10ms` units.
  - `ms` uses milliseconds directly.
  - `s` scales by `1000`.
  - sub-millisecond values are rounded to nearest millisecond.
  - accepted range is `0..1000ms`.
- Added separate internal delay parameters: `txdelay` and `axdelay` (both `uint16_t`, milliseconds).
- `DISP` now prints both `TXDELAY` and `AXDELAY`.
- Reworked `DISP` output into sectioned blocks (`Station`, `Network`, `Auto Operation`, `GPS / Sensor`, `Hardware`, `Diagnostics`) for easier reading while preserving all relevant fields.
- TX delay initialization keeps original defaults (`txdelay=100`, `axdelay=60`) while runtime conversion uses prior formula relationships (`2/3` and inverse).

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- `param_t` layout changed by adding `axdelay` and widening `txdelay`; persisted flash settings from older firmware may map unexpectedly until rewritten.
- Command/help output lines became slightly longer; queue constants and buffering sizes were not changed.

## 2026-04-18

### Request
Implement `privkey gen [type]` entropy-collection mode using user key input bytes + timing, then generate/store a new private key with normalized active type.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`
- `PLAN.md`

### Behavior changes
- Replaced immediate RNG-based `privkey gen` with interactive entropy collection mode:
  - command prints English guidance and starts `Remaining entropy counter: 640`.
  - per-key event mixes input byte, event index, high-resolution time, delta from previous event, burst length, and counter values into 32-byte internal hash state.
  - pasted/line-buffered bursts are accepted but score lower, so the visible counter decreases more slowly.
- Added `privkey gen` pending-input state machine that runs in existing TTY pending-input path (no queue model changes).
- On counter completion, derives a 32-byte secret from the accumulated state and re-hashes until a valid secp256k1 private-key range value is obtained.
- Stores generated key into persistent settings as:
  - `mona_privkey[32]` raw secret
  - `mona_privkey_compressed = 1` (via keyslot init)
  - `mona_active_type` normalized to `p2pkh|p2sh|p2wpkh`
  - `mona_privkey_valid = 1`

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- Entropy quality scoring uses timing/burst heuristics only; it is intentionally lightweight and not a certified TRNG assessment.
- Entropy collection now emits frequent short progress lines (`Remaining entropy counter: ...`); queue sizes were left unchanged, but heavy host-side buffering could still make visual updates appear bursty.

## 2026-04-18

### Request
Refine `privkey gen` UX with explicit operation/progress confirmation, ESC abort path, inline countdown overwrite, and save confirmation (`Enter` to save / `ESC` to abort).

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Generation start message updated to explicit operation notices:
  - `Initiating private key generation.`
  - keyboard-mash guidance
  - ESC abort warning block
- Progress counter is now shown inline and updated with carriage-return overwrite on the same line as much as possible.
- When entropy collection completes, key is prepared but not persisted immediately:
  - shows `Private key generation complete.`
  - waits for `[Enter]` to save or `[ESC]` to abort.
- On save, prints completion + critical key backup warning block.
- On abort (during collection or save confirmation), prints exactly `Aborted by user.` and returns to prompt without saving.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- Inline overwrite display behavior may vary by terminal emulation and host buffering; queue size and buffering constants were not changed.

## 2026-04-18

### Request
Clarify pending-input state naming so it is not tied to `privkey show` only.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Renamed the pending-input state type/variables to command-generic names:
  - `privkey_show_state_t` -> `cmd_pending_state_t`
  - `privkey_show_state` -> `cmd_pending_state`
  - `privkey_show_ttyp` -> `cmd_pending_ttyp`
- Updated enum value names to clearly separate `privkey show` confirm and `privkey gen` collecting states.
- No functional behavior change; this is a readability/maintenance naming cleanup.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- None newly introduced by this rename-only cleanup.

## 2026-04-20

### Summary
Fixed build break in `cmd_consume_pending_input()` by restoring the missing converse port constant used by sign TX confirmation.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- No functional behavior change intended.
- `sign` TX confirmation path now compiles again because `CONVERSE_PORT` is defined in `cmd.c`.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with:
  - `cmake --build build -j4` (failed: `build` directory did not exist)
  - `cmake -S . -B build` (failed: `PICO_SDK_PATH` not set in this environment)
- Full firmware build could not be completed in this environment.

### Remaining risks / TODO
- `CONVERSE_PORT` is now defined in both `tty.c` and `cmd.c`; consider centralizing this constant in a shared header in a later cleanup change.

## 2026-04-22

### Request
Fix `cmd: ` prompt desynchronization by centralizing prompt output and removing direct prompt prints from command/pending handlers in `cmd.c`.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/cmd.h`
- `pico_tnc/tty.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Added a single prompt helper `cmd_emit_prompt_if_idle()` in `cmd.c`.
  - Helper emits `cmd: ` only when the console is truly idle:
    - not in converse mode
    - not in calibrate mode
    - no pending command input state
- Replaced direct prompt writes in these paths to use the helper:
  - `privkey_gen_abort()`
  - `sign_qsl_wizard_consume_char()` abort path
  - `CMD_PENDING_PRIVKEY_SHOW_CONFIRM` completion/abort handling
  - `CMD_PENDING_SIGN_TX_CONFIRM` confirm/abort handling
  - calibrate mode exit path
- Updated `tty.c` CR/CTRL-C prompt emission to call the same helper, preventing prompt insertion while pending handlers are active.
- No command semantics were changed; this update only centralizes/synchronizes prompt rendering.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- Prompt logic is now centralized, but startup greeting still contains a static `cmd: ` suffix in `main.c` by design.
- USB/TTY output queue sizes were not changed; this prompt refactor reduces redundant prompt writes but does not alter queue capacity.

## 2026-04-22

### Request
Add `sign` readiness check mode (no args), move SIGN prerequisite checks to wizard start, and compact the QSL wizard pre-input guidance.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Added shared SIGN prerequisite checker (`sign_check_prerequisites`) that centralizes:
  - required setting checks (`MYCALL`, `UNPROTO`, private key)
  - user-facing prerequisite error messages
  - readiness return (`bool`)
- `sign` with no arguments now shows status summary:
  - `MYCALL`
  - `UNPROTO`
  - `ADDRESS` (active-type address when private key is present)
  - prints `Ready to go.` only when prerequisites are satisfied.
- `sign qsl` wizard now checks SIGN prerequisites immediately at start.
  - If missing, it prints prerequisite messages and does not enter wizard input mode.
- QSL wizard intro text is compacted to:
  - `Required: TO, RS, DATE, TIME`
  - `Optional: FREQ, MODE, QTH`
  - followed by `Please input the data.` and direct prompt.
- Input prompts were normalized to concise labels (`TO:`, `RS:`, `QTH:`).

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- `SIGN` no-arg status now derives/display active address text; if address derivation fails it reports `(calculation failed)`.
- USB/TTY output queue sizes were not changed; message volume changed slightly (status lines added for `SIGN` no-arg).

## 2026-04-22

### Request
Fix USB bootloader confirmation on CRLF terminals and resolve `cmd.c` build errors (`MONA_ERR_INVALID_ARG`, `ax25_sendVia` implicit declaration).

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `system usb_bootloader` pending confirmation now tolerates CRLF/LFCR line-ending leftovers before the first `Y` key:
  - while in `USB_BOOT_WAIT_Y`, incoming `\n` and `\r` are ignored instead of aborting.
- SIGN prerequisite status display no longer relies on undeclared `ax25_sendVia`; it now renders `UNPROTO` using existing callsign formatting logic.
- Fixed Monacoin error enum initialization from `MONA_ERR_INVALID_ARG` to `MONA_ERR_ARGS`.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- USB/TTY output queue sizes were not changed.
- USB bootloader confirmation now consumes one extra class of pending newline input (`\r`/`\n` at `USB_BOOT_WAIT_Y`), which is expected and should reduce false aborts on CRLF/LFCR terminals.

## 2026-04-22

### Request
Eliminate carriage-return based full-line redraw in command-line editing and switch to incremental terminal-safe updates for history navigation and in-line edits.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/tty.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Removed CR (`\r`) + full-line redraw path from command editor refresh handling.
- Added incremental cursor helpers:
  - left move uses repeated backspace writes
  - right move reprints existing buffer bytes under cursor
- Updated command history line replacement to avoid full repaint:
  - moves to logical line start using backspace
  - rewrites only changed suffix
  - clears only leftover trailing characters with spaces
  - restores cursor to target logical position
- Updated middle-of-line edit behavior to redraw only affected tail segment:
  - insert in middle prints inserted char + tail, then backtracks over tail
  - backspace/delete in middle print shifted tail + trailing space, then backtracks
- End-of-line fast paths remain minimal:
  - append prints only new character
  - backspace at end uses `BS SP BS`
- Home/End and left/right cursor movement now use incremental cursor motion without CR-based repaint.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- USB/TTY output queue sizes were not changed; this change reduces full-line output bursts during editing and replaces them with tail-only writes.
- Right-cursor movement relies on reprinting current buffer bytes, so behavior assumes printable ASCII command buffer content (same as existing command input constraints).

## 2026-04-22

### Request
Change command history recall redraw (↑/↓) to avoid carriage return and instead rewind with backspaces to line head before clearing/reprinting.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/tty.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Updated command-line refresh path to stop emitting `\r` when redrawing the editable line.
- Added `tty_rewind_and_clear_cmdline()`:
  - rewinds to line head using repeated BS based on `prompt + current cursor`
  - clears visible prompt+buffer using spaces
  - rewinds again via BS, then prints `cmd: ` and current buffer
- History navigation (`↑`/`↓`) now uses the same refresh path without CR, reducing terminal-dependent auto line-feed behavior.
- Queue/RAM impact note:
  - no queue size changes
  - redraw now emits more single-character writes (BS/SP) instead of one CR; this may slightly increase per-refresh byte count but avoids CR/LF interpretation issues on some terminals.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- Refresh still uses ANSI `ESC[K` to clear to end of line after redraw; terminals without ANSI erase support may still show stale characters.

## 2026-04-22

### Request
Separate responsibilities between `tty_set_cmdline()` and `tty_refresh_cmdline()` by preserving the pre-update command-line state and using it during redraw.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/tty.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `tty_set_cmdline()` now snapshots old command-line state (`old_idx`, `old_cursor`) before mutating `cmd_idx/cmd_cursor`, then passes that old state into redraw.
- `tty_refresh_cmdline()` and `tty_rewind_and_clear_cmdline()` now take old state parameters.
- Rewind distance now uses `CMD_PROMPT + old_cursor`.
- Clear span now uses `CMD_PROMPT + max(old_idx, new_idx)` to safely erase leftovers when new content is shorter than the old line.
- Existing Home/End redraw call sites (`CTRL_A/CTRL_E` and ANSI `H/F/~`) now also pass preserved old state before cursor updates.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- USB/TTY output queue sizes were not changed.
- Redraw still relies on ANSI `ESC[K` for end-of-line clearing support.

## 2026-04-23

### Request
Adjust `privkey gen` completion UX to show derived addresses, add Space-key respin, and fix the post-accept message to clarify that Flash save is not done until `perm`.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `privkey gen` completion now prints the generated address set (`p2pkh`, `p2sh`, `p2wpkh`) immediately after `Private key generation complete.`.
- Added completion prompt controls:
  - `Space`: respin pending secret
  - `Enter`: accept pending secret into runtime settings
  - `ESC`: abort
- Respin behavior now mutates pending raw key material by adding current tick-derived value, then re-hashes and validates secp256k1 range before updating pending secret.
- Replaced misleading completion text (`Save complete.`) after accept with guidance that key is not yet saved to Flash and user must run `perm`.
- Updated command descriptions in both English/Japanese READMEs to reflect respin/accept/save flow.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- USB/TTY queue sizes were not changed.
- Completion output now includes additional lines (address block + respin prompt), which increases output volume per generation completion but does not alter queue allocation sizes.

## 2026-04-23

### Request
Restore the `CRITICAL NOTICE` block in `privkey gen` accept output while keeping the new unsaved/`perm` guidance and explicit blank-line layout.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `privkey gen` accept path now prints:
  - `The private key has not yet been saved.`
  - blank line
  - `CRITICAL NOTICE` 4-line warning block
  - blank line
  - `Run "perm" ...` and `Run the "privkey show" ...`
  - trailing blank line
- No changes to key generation, respin algorithm, or pending-state transitions.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- USB/TTY queue sizes were not changed.
- Output length in accept path remains longer than pre-change due to warning and guidance lines.

## 2026-04-24

### Request
Change the `sign qsl` payload format from flat `{"QSL":"...","S":...}` to nested `{"QSL":{"C":"...","S":...}}`.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `sign qsl` JSON construction now emits:
  - `{"QSL":{"C":"<to>","S":"<rs>","D":"<date>","T":"<time>","F":"<freq>","M":"<mode>","P":"<qth>"}}`
- Argument parsing, wizard flow, signing flow, and TX confirmation behavior are unchanged.
- Updated English/Japanese command documentation to reflect the new nested QSL format.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- USB/TTY queue sizes were not changed.
- Payload text for `sign qsl` is slightly longer due to the nested object wrapper (`"QSL":{"C":...}`), which may marginally increase output bytes per signed frame without changing any queue allocation.

## 2026-04-24

### Request
Fix `sign qsl` option parsing so `-qth` stops at the next option token (space + `-`), and trim extra leading/trailing spaces around text fields.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- In `sign qsl` argument mode, `-qth` now consumes tokens only until the next `-option` token instead of always consuming the full remaining command tail.
  - Example now supported as intended: `-qth Akihabara Tokyo -freq 433.123 -mode FM`
- Added explicit trim for leading/trailing whitespace on parsed `-qth` text before validation/storage.
- Updated English/Japanese command docs to mention that `-qth` ends at the next option.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- USB/TTY queue sizes were not changed.
- `-qth` values that intentionally begin with `-` remain unsupported in argument mode because `-...` is treated as the next option token.

## 2026-04-24

### Request
On packet receive, detect whether the packet information field starts with JSON; keep legacy output for non-JSON, and when JSON has a trailing signature, attempt Monacoin signature-address recovery with progress/time output.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/decode.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Receive display now performs an additional check on AX.25 information field bytes:
  - If the info field does not start with a JSON object, output remains unchanged.
  - If it starts with JSON but has no trailing signature bytes, output remains unchanged.
  - If trailing bytes exist and are not the expected compact-signature Base64 length (88), an error line is printed.
- When a JSON payload has an appended 88-byte Base64 signature, the receiver now prints:
  - `Digital signature calculation in progress... Completed. (<time>us)`
  - then either `Signature address:<address>` on successful recovery or `Signature error: <reason>` on failure.
- Address recovery chooses display address type from the signature header guess (`mona1` / `P` / `M`) after recovery.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- USB/TTY queue sizes were not changed.
- Added receive-path status/error lines increase text output volume per signed JSON frame, which may increase queue occupancy during burst receive traffic without changing queue allocation.

## 2026-04-25

### Request
When receiving JSON that contains `"QSL":{}`, keep current logs and then print an indented card-style framed log after successful address recovery.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/decode.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Kept existing receive logs (`Digital signature calculation...`, `Signature address:...`) unchanged.
- Added an extra blank line and an indented (`2` spaces) framed `Digitally Signed QSL Card` block after successful signature address recovery when the signed JSON includes a top-level `QSL` object.
- Card fields are populated as follows:
  - `From` from AX.25 source address.
  - `To Call/Report/Date/Time/Freq/Mode/QTH` from `QSL` keys `C/S/D/T/F/M/P`.
  - `Extended entries` from unknown keys present in `QSL`.
  - `Signature` wrapped at 45 characters into two lines.
  - `Signed ID (Mona address)` from recovered address.
  - `Status   : OK`.
- No queue size constants were changed. Added receive-path output bytes for qualifying packets may increase USB/TTY queue occupancy during bursts.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- QSL card parser is intentionally lightweight and expects the standard compact `QSL` object format used by current `sign qsl` output.

## 2026-04-25

### Request
Refactor the QSL card generator into a reusable subroutine and also show the same card as a send-side preview immediately before `Ready to send.` with status `Preview`.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/qsl_card.h`
- `pico_tnc/qsl_card.c`
- `pico_tnc/decode.c`
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/CMakeLists.txt`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Extracted QSL card parse/render logic into reusable module:
  - `qsl_card_parse(...)`
  - `qsl_card_render(...)`
- Receive path now reuses the shared renderer and keeps status frame as `OK`.
- Send path (`sign` flow) now detects signed JSON containing top-level `QSL` and prints the same indented framed card just before `Ready to send...`.
  - `From` in preview uses current `MYCALL`.
  - Signed ID uses current active Monacoin address.
  - Status frame in preview is `Preview`.
- Queue size constants were not changed; additional send-side preview text may increase USB/TTY queue occupancy during burst command output.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- JSON parsing remains lightweight and intentionally tuned for current compact `QSL` payload format.

## 2026-04-25

### Request
On the receive-side QSL card output, change the status row from `Status   : OK` to `Status   : OK` plus a right-aligned `Confirming Our QSO.` message.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/qsl_card.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Updated QSL card renderer so that when `status` is `OK`, the status line includes:
  - `Status   : OK` followed by spacing and `Confirming Our QSO.` near the right side of the 46-character content width.
- Non-`OK` statuses (e.g., `Preview`) remain unchanged.
- Queue size constants were not changed. This adds up to 19 characters on receive-side `OK` status lines, which may slightly increase USB/TTY queue occupancy during burst output without changing queue allocation.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- Right alignment is constrained by fixed 46-character card content width; if status text is expanded in the future, spacing before `Confirming Our QSO.` may shrink.

## 2026-04-26

### Request
Update source file headers to match repository license structure for files touched in this task.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/libmona_pico/mona_compat.c`
- `pico_tnc/libmona_pico/mona_compat.h`
- `pico_tnc/libmona_pico/mona_pico_api.c`
- `pico_tnc/libmona_pico/mona_pico_api.h`
- `pico_tnc/mona_backend_minimal.c`
- `pico_tnc/mona_backend_minimal.h`
- `pico_tnc/libmona_pico/tools/mona_backend_openssl.c`
- `pico_tnc/libmona_pico/tools/mona_backend_openssl.h`
- `pico_tnc/libmona_pico/tools/mona_cli.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- No firmware runtime behavior changes.
- Added concise English MIT header notices at the top of touched source files.
- No USB/TTY queue sizes or output paths were changed.

### Validation status
- Header-only change; full firmware build not run in this task.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- Files that already carry third-party upstream headers were not altered in this task.

## 2026-04-26

### Request
Update headers for upstream-derived source files modified in this project by appending the required Modifications notice below existing upstream headers.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/cmd.h`
- `pico_tnc/decode.c`
- `pico_tnc/main.c`
- `pico_tnc/tnc.h`
- `pico_tnc/tty.c`
- `pico_tnc/tty.h`
- `pico_tnc/usb_output.c`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- No runtime behavior changes.
- Preserved original upstream BSD header blocks and appended a short English Modifications notice directly below each.
- No USB/TTY queue sizes or output path logic were changed.

### Validation status
- Header-only change; full firmware build not run in this task.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- Additional upstream-derived files may still need similar notice updates if they are modified in future tasks.

## 2026-04-27

### Request
On receive-side QSL card output, insert a `Raw Data` row above `Signature` and display the signed data body wrapped at 45 characters per line. Also change `sign msg` JSON key from lowercase `msg` to uppercase `MSG`.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/qsl_card.h`
- `pico_tnc/qsl_card.c`
- `pico_tnc/decode.c`
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- QSL card renderer now includes a `Raw Data` section immediately before the `Signature` section, and wraps both raw data and signature text at 45 characters per rendered line.
- Receive-side QSL card path now passes the signed JSON body into the renderer so the card shows the exact data paired with the signature.
- `sign msg <text>` now signs JSON payloads as `{"MSG":"<text>"}` instead of `{"msg":"<text>"}`.
- Updated English/Japanese README command docs for `sign msg` payload key.
- USB/TTY queue allocation constants are unchanged; added output lines can increase transient queue occupancy during card rendering.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- `Raw Data` rendering shows escaped JSON text as signed (not pretty-printed), which is intentional for signature pairing visibility.

## 2026-04-27

### Request
For `sign qsl` argument mode, extend parsing so not only `-qth` but all elements accept spaces and are read as-written until the next option token (or end).

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `sign qsl` argument parser now treats option values consistently across all supported options (`TO`, `-rs`, `-date`, `-time`, `-freq`, `-mode`, `-qth`):
  - values may include spaces,
  - capture continues until the next recognized `-option` token or end of input.
- `MODE` and `TO` keep existing uppercase normalization behavior.
- No queue-size constants changed; parser-only change with no USB/TTY output path growth.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- Values that intentionally begin with `-` are interpreted as options; users should avoid leading hyphen in value text for now.

## 2026-04-27

### Request
Add `"FR":"<MYCALL>"` at the beginning of JSON generated by both `sign msg` and `sign qsl`. On receive-side QSL card output, use `FR` for the `From` row when present; if absent, use packet-header callsign and append `   *UNSIGNED`.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/qsl_card.h`
- `pico_tnc/qsl_card.c`
- `pico_tnc/decode.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `sign msg` payload now starts with `{"FR":"<MYCALL>","MSG":"..."}`.
- `sign qsl` payload now starts with `{"FR":"<MYCALL>","QSL":{...}}`.
- QSL parser now reads top-level `FR` string into card metadata.
- Receive-side QSL card `From` line behavior:
  - if `FR` exists: show `FR` value,
  - if `FR` missing: show packet-header source callsign plus `   *UNSIGNED` suffix.
- USB/TTY queue constants unchanged; fallback `*UNSIGNED` suffix can slightly increase one card line length usage within existing output buffering.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- `FR` parsing is top-level string-key lookup; non-string `FR` values are ignored.

## 2026-04-27

### Request
Implement advertisement command for signature address/profile:
- command: `sign adv`
- args: `-name <name>` `-bio <bio>`
- payload: `{"FR":"<MYCALL>","ADV":{"N":"<name>","B":"<bio>","A":"<active_address>"}}`

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `pico_tnc/help.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Added `sign adv -name ... -bio ...` subcommand under `sign`.
- Added ADV argument parser:
  - `-name` and `-bio` are required.
  - each value may include spaces until the next recognized ADV option token.
- Added ADV JSON builder and sign flow:
  - includes top-level `FR` from current `MYCALL`.
  - includes `ADV.A` as the currently active Monacoin address type derived from the stored private key.
- Updated help text and README (EN/JP) command documentation.
- Queue constants unchanged; ADV payload can be longer than MSG/QSL and may increase signed-frame length/queue occupancy while still using existing length checks.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- ADV parsing treats tokens beginning with `-` as option markers (`-name`, `-bio`); leading-hyphen value text is not currently representable without format extension.

## 2026-04-27

### Request
Set signed JSON `FR` callsign to `JA1UMW` and update `INTRODUCTION_JP.md` signature-structure section to match all current payload formats (including `sign adv` sample values).

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `INTRODUCTION_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- `FR` in generated signed JSON is now fixed to `JA1UMW` for `sign msg`, `sign qsl`, and `sign adv`.
- Updated command docs (EN/JP) to show `FR:"JA1UMW"`.
- Updated `INTRODUCTION_JP.md` signature-structure section to current formats:
  - `MSG` with `FR`
  - `QSL` with `FR`
  - `ADV` sample with requested values:
    - `N`: `Daisuke/CQAKIBA`
    - `B`: `Testing the digital signature system using monacoin`
    - `A`: `MLA4htCpCC9APoi8Yk6LZMT8aAwFMnMEUo`
- Queue constants unchanged; this task mainly updates payload source field and documentation text.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- `FR` is currently a fixed identifier (`JA1UMW`), so it does not track runtime `MYCALL` changes.

## 2026-04-27

### Request
Revert actual code behavior for `FR` to use runtime `MYCALL` again, while keeping `INTRODUCTION_JP.md` dummy/sample `FR` as `JA1UMW`.

### Files changed
- `pico_tnc/cmd.c`
- `README.md`
- `README_JP.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`

### Behavior changes
- Restored signed JSON `FR` generation in firmware code to derive from current `MYCALL` setting.
- Updated sign-msg error text back to `MYCALL` wording for consistency.
- README examples (EN/JP) now document `FR` as `<MYCALL>` again.
- `INTRODUCTION_JP.md` sample `FR` remains `JA1UMW` as requested (dummy/example usage).
- Queue constants unchanged; this is payload source-field and documentation alignment only.

### Validation status
- Build attempted with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j4`; build is not possible in this environment because `PICO_SDK_PATH` (or `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`) is not configured.

### Remaining risks / TODOs
- None newly introduced beyond existing SDK build-environment limitation.
